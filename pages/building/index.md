# Building

I'm always making things, open source, micro-startups or just pet projects to experiment, learn and keep my technical skills sharp.

## Current projects

<Card title="Storyden" image="https://www.storyden.org/social-1280-640.png" url="https://www.storyden.org/" verb="building" noun="storyden" layout="left">
A social knowledgebase platform for collecting, curating and sharing content.

Storyden is inspired by bulletin boards of the retro web but under a fresh coat of paint.

Powered by artificial intelligence, a community can aggregate, organise and discuss their niche on the platform or without leaving their favourite apps such as WhatsApp, Discord, Slack and more.

Odin is a platform for building a better future by making capital
easier to deploy.

I was incredibly fortunate enough to join Paddy Ryan and Mary Lin
in taking their MVP to a fully-fledged product.

We built an incredible team and a smooth product used by some of
the biggest angel investors and venture funds in the UK and
Europe.

## Past projects

<Card title="Scavenge & Survive" image="https://scavengesurvive.com/img/f3-survival.jpg" layout="left" objectPosition="center">

Scavenge and Survive was a PvP survival game where everyone is pitched against each other. Supplies are scarce and everyone is willing to kill for the same goals! Safety in numbers is key to survival, but trust is hard to find.

A small but disruptive direct-to-consumer business in the vape industry. I worked closely with a great designer friend of mine to build their brand identity.
