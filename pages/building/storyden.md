# Storyden

[Storyden](https://storyden.org) is the platform for managing your community and its content, wherever they call home. Run a forum, a blog, post news, aggregate links, build a directory, a knowledgebase and more.

## Birth: 2021

Storyden started life as a forum built in to the [open.mp](https://open.mp) website.

We were tired of dealing with ancient, awkward and slow forum software like myBB, IPB, Discourse, etc...

So I started to build one from scratch, it didn't seem that hard since we already had a login system and a users table etc. what else was there? posts? categories? a few APIs?

## Refinement: 2022

Suddenly I realised there was a bit of a gap in the market for something fresh and modern.

So perhaps it would be fun project to refine my full stack skills since I'd recently joined Odin as the first senior engineering hire to build out their technical infrastructure and team while we migrated off an MVP system to a future-proof setup.

This meant thinking about the design, spending a lot of time in Figma and also discussing the direction of the product with friends and members of my Discord communities.

Lots of experimentation happened, it was a fun process!

## Focus: 2023+

This is when I started to realise there could be something really valuable in this exploration. Not just a forum but something larger.

I wrote about this more here: https://www.storyden.org/blog/building-running-administrating-modern-forum-software

And the rest is history, the project became a product. Branding was refreshed, a strategy started to emerge and I decided to double down on building something ambitious.
